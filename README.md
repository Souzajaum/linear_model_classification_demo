# Linear_Model_Classification_Demo
This project is part of the early stages of my deep learning journey.

This code demonstrates the application of a linear model on synthetic data using fundamental concepts learned in the Descriptive and General Statistics course. It creates a two-dimensional dataset and plots a line that separates two classes based on a linear equation. The model is visualized graphically, and a random point is classified relative to this line, illustrating how the model works in practice. Additionally, the model's accuracy is evaluated, providing a measure of its effectiveness in classifying the data. This accuracy assessment is crucial for statistical inference, a discipline I will explore later in the Statistics course.

Furthermore, in addition to showcasing the application of a linear model on synthetic data, I also found the new values of the equation that solve a new classification problem. This is evidenced by the random generation of a data point and its subsequent classification based on the equation of the line.
